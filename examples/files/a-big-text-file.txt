This is going to be a larger text file just to see what this looks like
when it's placed into the mix here. 

I have no idea what this will end up doing when I call it from the program but that is
the point entirely... 

I think I am getting the hag of this GOlang thing but I have only been doing very basic
things here thus far.

The next chapters that I am about to embark upon get much more into the practical use of this
language for real world scenarios, so we'll see how things go as we get past the 'basics' and
get into the 'meat' of what can be done with this language.
